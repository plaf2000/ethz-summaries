## Instructions for custom css

In order to benefit from the custom css you have to:

1. Create the new file `base.user.css` folder into the `themes` folder from Typora (if not already present). [Here](https://support.typora.io/Add-Custom-CSS/#open-theme-folder) are the instruction to find this folder.

2. Open the file.

3. Type in at the beginning of the file

   ```css
   @import "<directory_to_the_cloned_project>/summaries/themes/summary.css";
   ```
